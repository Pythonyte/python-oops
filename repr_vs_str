the __repr__ method is often used to provide
an as-code low-level display of an object when present,

and __str__ is reserved for more user-friendly informational displays like ours here.

Sometimes classes provide both a __str__ for user-friendly displays and a __repr__ with extra details for developers to view.

Because printing runs __str__ and the interactive prompt echoes results with __repr__,
this can provide both target audiences with an appropriate display.
