all the important concepts in Python’s OOP machinery:
• Instance creation—filling out instance attributes
• Behavior methods—encapsulating logic in a class’s methods
• Operator overloading—providing behavior for built-in operations like printing
• Customizing behavior—redefining methods in subclasses to specialize them
• Customizing constructors—adding initialization logic to superclass steps
